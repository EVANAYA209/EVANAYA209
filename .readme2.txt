Hey if you found this...
you are gonna be a good hacker and coder one day.
I believe in you.
If people are making fun of you and you want to have some alone time, thats fine.
I know this world isn't how it's supposed to be.
But, you can make a difference.
Be the kind of person you want to be, nobody has to tell you what to do.
